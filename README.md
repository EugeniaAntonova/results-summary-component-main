### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

I have started with the very basic markup, trying to avoid complexity and unnessesery wrappers, using semantic tags as much as i found possible.
When the markup and styles were done, I have decided to add a little bit more of accessability, allowing user to use Enter-key to follow the link, if they prefer to use keyboard.
At last I decided to render data dynamicly, to challenge myself a little harder. I did not know that you can`t import json in js module! Had to find a way and found it in fetch api.
This was really new to me. Now I`m happy it works predictable. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to work with json files via fetch api. Did not learn, but reinforsed working with templates.

### Continued development

I need to learn more and practice in semantic markup, accessability, css preprocessors, fetch api and js as I find those my weakest. 

### Useful resources

MDN healps a great deal!
